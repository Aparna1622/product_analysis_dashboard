## üí¨ Interview Explanation Snippet

> ‚ÄúMy dashboard helped surface key operational insights, such as an 80-day average delay in order closure, and a
positive downward trend in disconnected orders. By comparing total discount and closed orders across regions,
I observed that higher discounts directly led to more closures. This allowed me to recommend increasing discounts in
> underperforming areas. I also built customer-level insights to prioritize marketing toward low-engagement companies. These findings are presented with visual clarity and documented for decision-makers.‚Äù
